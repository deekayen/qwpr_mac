Instructions:

1. Put the one of the .keylayout files in /Library/Keyboard Layouts/.
   a. qwpr2_0.keylayout: this is the version with “y” in the QWERTY position (11 moves)
   a. qwpr3_1.keylayout: this is the version with “y” in QWERTY “n” and
      “j” in QWERTY “y” (12 moves, but less use of the badly-stretched QWERTY “y”).
2. Activate it in the Language & Text section of System Preferences.
3. Download, install, and launch Karabiner (was KeyRemap4MacBook): 
	http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/index.html.en
4. Put the private.xml file in:
	/Users/<YourUserName>/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook
5. Tell Karabiner to reload the private.xml, and activate the four options
6. To make sure application shifting still works, you may need to install 
  and activate LiteSwitch X: http://liteswitch.en.softonic.com/mac

Optional:
7. Turn on keyboard viewer (under the keyboard layout menu, which you may
    have to turn on in keyboard preferences) so you can see what types what.
    Also, Get Ukelele so you can see / browse / search / change the layout:
	http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele
	(Note that if you make changes, they will not reflect in running apps
	until you close and relaunch them.)
        (For instance: if you want minimal same-finger pairs, you can swap W/R 
        and rotate U/K/L to L/U/K. That’s 5 more finger switches and 3 more moved
        letters total, but better ergonomics. You need to switch \ and ] back manually.)
8. Learn your new keyboard. For the first few hours, it's best to practice 
	using real words, starting with only the most common letters and adding a 
	few letters at a time. A good resource for this is http://thetypingcat.com
	(set to "qwpr" and "random words" using the menus at top. Also, there's 
	http://learn.dvorak.nl/ )
9. Use the extra characters. This keymap has hundreds of unicode characters
	available. To see how to type them, you can choose "Show Keyboard Viewer"
	from the keyboard menu in the upper right. (If you don't have that menu,
	you can turn it on in 
	[apple menu::system preferences::languages and text::input sources::show...])
